Installed latest php and composer using brew

Database design using lucidchart

Made model and migration table

php artisan make:model -m Expense

npm install to install package.json depedencies

npm run dev to run vite

Seeded our admin user and logged in
Tested both login and register function and works great

Now we should make the frontend for expenses registration, view, edit

Make the form so the employee can make new expense

Make validations

php artisan make:request StoreExpenseRequest

Made index route

Used the fullCalendar library

Displayed the database records to the calendar

Calculated sum for expenses for both admin and employee

Made show route

Made the show view showing the specific expense

There is no need to install a frontend framework because the only functionality is a single calendar

Make middlewares to protect routes

Upload images and serve them privately
